# my-first-web-app
A static mini-site that displays data (taken from one of NASA's open APIs) concerning potentially hazardous space objects that threaten our existence on Earth!

The toolchain used to deploy this site includes:
 - JSX, a React-related set of syntax extensions that allow you to do things like defining component structures inside JavaScript.
 - The latest built-in JavaScript features such as import.
 - Development tools such as Prettier for formatting and ESLint for linting.
 - PostCSS to provide CSS nesting capabilities.
 - Parcel to build and minify our code, and to write a bunch of configuration file content automatically for us.
 - GitHub to manage our source code control.
 - Netlify to automate our deployment process.
